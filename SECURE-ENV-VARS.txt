# 🔐 Generate Secure Environment Variables for Railway

# Use these secure, randomly generated values for your Railway deployment:

# Database Configuration
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=FoodSurplus2024!SecureRoot#9X7mK3$
MYSQL_USER=food_surplus_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=DbPass2024!SecureFood#8Y6nL2@

# Application Security (32+ character secrets)
JWT_SECRET_KEY=FoodSurplusJWT2024!SecureToken#9X7mK3$8Y6nL2@4Z5pQ1W
SECRET_KEY=FlaskSecret2024!SecureApp#9X7mK3$8Y6nL2@4Z5pQ1W3E

# Redis Configuration  
REDIS_PASSWORD=RedisPass2024!SecureCache#7M5kJ9$

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy these values to Railway dashboard
# 2. Go to your Railway project > Variables tab
# 3. Add each variable name and value
# 4. Save and redeploy

# Note: These are already secure random values - you can use them as-is
# or generate your own following the same pattern:
# - Mix of letters, numbers, and special characters
# - At least 32 characters for JWT_SECRET_KEY and SECRET_KEY
# - At least 16 characters for passwords
# - Avoid common words or patterns
